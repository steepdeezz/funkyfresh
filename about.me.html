    <p>About Me</p>
    <p>Wassup My Homies!</p>
    <p>As you may know by visiting my page I am Ethan Jensen and this is just my website porfolio for my Digital Media class. I like doing digital media and its a cool hobby for me. But its not my favorite thing to do in my spare time. I also like to play baseball and am currently on my High Schools team and am having a great time. Though baseball is my favorite sport I love all sports except golf. I love to hangout with my friends and go to parties. Im the oldest of 4 children in my family and love to take care of my 2 yr old baby sister. I hope you enjoy my media webpage.</p>
